## 🏗 Technical Architecture

### Clean Architecture Implementation (without domain layer)


## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Flutter & Dart  
- **Architecture Pattern**: Clean Architecture (feature-first, no domain layer)  
- **State Management**: Cubit pattern using `freezed` for immutable states  
- **Routing**: `go_router` for declarative and nested navigation  
- **Screen Adaptation**: `flutter_screenutil` for responsive UI  
- **Networking**:  
  - `retrofit` for type-safe HTTP requests  
  - `retrofit_generator` for code generation  
- **Code Generation**:  
  - `freezed`, `freezed_annotation` for data classes and union types  
  - `json_serializable`, `json_annotation` for JSON serialization
